",این یافته‌ها، چالش‌های فراروی جمهوریخواهان و دموکرات‌ها را در «کمیته عالی» ویژه کنگره پررنگتر می‌کند. این کمیته مسئول کاهش حداقل 2/1 میلیارد دلار از بودجه فدرال در بیش از 10 سال آینده است.

Like the government's Social Security pension system for the elderly, Medicare is also expected to be a hot-button issue in 2012 election politics for both parties as they vie for control of the White House and Congress.

",دفتر سرشماری در گزارشی عنوان می‌کند که بر خلاف راه‌حل رسمی فقر دفتر سرشماری که بر بودجه‌های غذایی و دستمزدهای نقدی برای فقرا تمرکز می‌کند، محاسبه جدید شامل مزایای دولتی مانند برچسب‌های غذایی و نیز هزینه های خانوار مانند مالیات‌ها، هزینه‌های درمانی، تفاوت‌های مسکن و منطقه‌ای در هزینه زندگی است.

The broader formula generates an overall U.S. poverty rate of 16 percent, versus an official 15.1 percent, with an annual poverty income threshold of $24,343 for a family of four, compared with $22,113 under the official measure.

",علاوه بر این، فرمول جدید نشان می‌دهد که نرخ فقر برای سفید‌پوستان، آسیایی ها و بزرگسالان در سن کار در حال افزایش ولی برای سیاهان و کودکان در حال کاهش است.
79,"
For the first time, the poverty rate for Hispanics eclipsed the rate among blacks, by 28.2 percent to 25.4 percent, partly as a result of less participation in social programs, like housing subsidies, among immigrant groups.
",برای اولین بار، نرخ فقر برای اسپانیولی‌ها با میزان 2/28 درصد، نرخ فقر جامعه سیاهان با نرخ 4/25 درصد، تحت الشعاع قرار داد و این امر تا حدی به خاطر مشارکت کمتر ‌گروههای مهاجر در برنامه‌های اجتماعی مانند یارانه‌های مسکن است.

179," ""Either the tests confirm Skinner's guilt or prove his innocence and prevent the state from making an irreversible mistake. There is simply no downside.""",«این آزمایش ها جرم اسکینر یا بی‌گناهی او را ثابت می‌کنند و مانع از آن می‌شوند که این ایالت، اشتباه برگشت‌ناپذیری را انجام دهد. این آزمایش، هیچ اثر منفی به دنبال ندارد.»

Monday's decision comes four days after the trial court denied Skinner's latest request for DNA testing on a variety of items collected by police, including vaginal swabs from Busby contained in a rape kit; clippings from her fingernails; two knives, one found on Busby's front porch and the second found in a plastic bag in the living room; a dish towel; and blood and hairs from a jacket found next to Busby's body.
",تصمیم روز دوشنبه، چهار روز بعد از آن اتخاذ می‌شود که دادگاه، آخرین درخواست اسکینر برای آزمایش DNA بر روی اقلام متنوع جمع شده توسط پلیس رد شد. این اقلام عبارت بودند از پنبه مبهلی از باسبی موجود در بسته تجاوز؛ تکه‌هایی از ناخن‌های او؛ دو چاقو، یکی در جلوی باسبی و دومی در کیسه پلاستیکی در اتاق نشیمن؛ حوله سینی غذا و خون و موهایی از نیمتنه یافت شده در کنار بدن باسنی

",اگر مونتی نخست‌وزیر شود، می‌توان انتظار داشت که رویکرد کاملاً متفاوتی را نسبت به سه سال گذشته برای حکمرانی بر ایتالیا پیشه کند.

Dubbed Super Mario for his work in international finance, he served as a leading European Commission member for a decade -- including as commissioner for its financial services, market and taxation committee between 1995 and 1999 and as head of its competition committee from 1999 to 2004.
",او به خاطر کارش در امور مالی بین المللی به عنوان سوپر ماریو نامیده می‌شود. او به مدت یکدهه به عنوان عضو برجسته کمیسیون اروپایی خدمت کرد-منجمله به عنوان مامور عالیرتبه برای خدمات مالی‌اش، کمیته بازار و مالیات‌گیری بین سالهای 1995 و 1999 و رئیس کمیته رقابتی آن از سال 1999 تا 2004
647,"
In the latter role, Monti gained prominence for his part in blocking a merger between U.S. firms Honeywell International and General Electric, thought to be a move that highlighted Europe's newfound regulatory clout.
",بعد از آن، مونتی به‌خاطر نقش خود در توقف ادغام بین شرکتهای آمریکایی هانیول اینترنشنال و جنرال الکتریک، به مقام برجسته‌ای رسید. به نظر می‌رسید که این حرکت، نقش تنظیمی نوبنیاد اروپا را پر‌ رنگ کرده است.

He also tangled with U.S. computing giant Microsoft, ruling in 2004 that it had broken EU competition law by having ""abused its virtual monopoly power over the PC desktop in Europe.""
",او با مایکروسافت غول رایانه‌ای ایالات متحده نیز درگیر شده است و در سال 2004 حکم داد که این کشور با «سوءاستفاده از قدرت انحصاری مجازی خود بر رایانه‌های شخصی رومیزی در اروپا» قانون رقابتی اتحادیه اروپا را نقض کرده است.

",اما رزومه مونتی گذشته از نقشهای مشورتی با شرکت سرمایه گذاری گولدمن ساچز و کوکا کولا، نشان می‌دهد که به همان اندازه که شخصیتی دانشگاهی و سیاستگذار است، شخصیتی تجاری نیز می‌باشد.

",او می نویسد:«بررسی منشای( آن)، حداقل ما را به هویت رهبران اولیه آن رهنمون کرد و جستجو برای رهبری گسترده تر جنبش باید از آن‌جا ادامه یابد.»
811,"
A sampling of leading journalism educators that Brisbane polled, many of them former top newspaper editors, agreed.

",نمونه‌‌‌ای از ‌مربیان برجسته روزنامه‌نگاری‌ در نظرسنجی بریسبان که  بیشتر ‌آن‌ها از سردبیران برجسته سابق بودند نیز با این نظر موافق بودند. 
812,"
""Most said it was important to understand who the leaders were and what demographics they represented,"" Brisbane reports.",بریسبان گزارش می‌دهد:«بیشتر ‌آن‌ها گفتند که درک این‌که رهبران چه کسانی هستند و این‌کهچه نوع جمعیت‌شناسی را ارائه می‌دهند، اهمیت داشته است.» 
813,"""Leadership tells you a lot about a movement,"" Jerry Ceppos, the former executive editor of the San Jose Mercury News, told Brisbane.",جری کپوس، ویراستار اجرایی سابق سن خوزه مرکوری نیوز به بریسبان می‌گوید:«رهبری چیزهای زیادی را در مورد جنبش به شما می‌گوید.»
814," ""But I can't I can't cite the name of a single Occupy Wall Street leader.",«اما نمی‌توانم از یک رهبر جنبش اشغال وال استریت نام ببرم.
815, I know some members say the groups are 'leaderless.',می‌دانم که برخی اعضا می‌گویند که این گروهها، بدون رهبر هستند.
816, But I have trouble believing that this is an entirely organic movement that grew without a leader.,اما به سختی می‌توانم باور کنم که این جنبشی کاملاً زنده است که بدون رهبر رشد کرده است.
817," I'd push hard to see if there are leaders and to profile them.""
",«به شدت دنبال آن هستم تا ببینم که رهبرانی وجود دارند و ‌آن‌ها را در مقاله‌ای کوتاه توصیف کنم.»
818,"
Why this insistence on finding the supposed leaders of Occupy Wall Street? The reason goes beyond a desire to understand the movement's goals, I think, into something more existential that is rooted in a fundamental misunderstanding of how networking technology is changing politics.
",چرا این اصرار بر یافتن رهبران فرضی جنبش اشغال وال استریت وجود دارد؟ این دلیل فراتر ازتمایل به درک اهداف جنبش است و  به نظرم دلیل آن، چیزی است که ماهیت وجودی بیشتری دارد و آن چیزی است که در سوتفاهم بنیادی ازچگونگی کارکرد فناوری شبکه‌سازی در تغییر سیاست ریشه دارد.
819,"
For many traditional political observers such as Brisbane and his colleagues, the notion that a political movement might arise without charismatic leaders is inconceivable. ",برای بسیاری از ناظران سیاسی سنتی مانند بریسبان و همکارانش، این مفهوم که جنبش سیاسی ممکن است بدون رهبران کاریزماتیک باشد، امری غیرقابل درک است.
820,"Every previous movement, after all, has had its figureheads. ",از این گذشته، تمامی جنبش‌های قبلی روسایی داشته اند.
821,"Think of Gandhi, MLK, Mandela. Or, at the less exalted level of recent times, think of Ralph Nader, Al Sharpton or Michael Moore on the progressive left, or Sarah Palin, Mark Meckler and Jenny Beth Martin on the Tea Party right.",به گاندی، مارتین لوترکینگ، ماندلا یا در سطح کمتر در زمانهای اخیر، به رالف نادر، ال شارپتون یا مایکل مور در چپ پیشرو یا سارا پالین، مارک مکلر و جنی بث مارتین در حزب راست تی‌پارتی توجه کنید.
822," The same question was raised, if you recall, around the Arab Spring uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, which were often described as ""leaderless.""
",اگر به قیام‌های بهار عربی در تونس و مصر که اغلب به عنوان «بدون رهبر» توصیف شده، نگاه کنید نیز همین سئوال به ذهن می‌آید.
823,"
A movement can't be leaderless, right? 
",یک جنبش نمی‌تواند بدون رهبر باشد، این طور نیست؟
824,Who would we feature on the front page? ,چه کسی را در صفحه نخست نشان دهیم؟
825,Who would we put on the Sunday talk shows?,در نمایشهای گفتگوی یکشنبه با  چه کسی گفتگو کنیم؟
826, Who would we negotiate with?,با چه کسی مذاکره کنیم؟

Or if you're feeling some distress about politics in America today, who might lead us to cure all that plagues us, from economic doldrums to climate change to failures of leadership in so many other institutions, from corporate boardrooms to the church to college football programs?",یا اگر درباره سیاست امروز آمریکا احساس پریشانی می‌کنید، چه کسی ما را به درمان تمامی گرفتاریها از رکود اقتصادی گرفته تا تغییرات آب و هوایی تا شکست رهبری در بسیاری از سازمانهای دیگر از اتاقهای هیئت مدیره گرفته تا کلیسا تا برنامه‌های فوتبال کالج،  رهبری خواهد کرد؟
828," Is there a savior rising from these streets?
",آیا از این خیابانها یک ناجی برخواهد خواست؟
829,"No, political movements can't be leaderless.",نه، جنبشهای سیاسی نمی‌توانند بدون رهبر باشند.
830," The Occupy Wall Street movement is, in fact, leader-full.
",در حقیقت جنبش اشغال وال استریت، پر از رهبر است.
831,"
But it's a vastly different kind of leadership that is emerging.",اما نوع کاملاً متفاوتی از رهبری در حال ظهور است.
832," It's one that, like the networked technology that supports it, rejects all forms of top-down hierarchy and values peer-to-peer network weaving instead.
",این شکل از رهبری مانند فناوری شبکه‌سازی شده که از آن پشتیبانی می‌کند، تمامی اشکال سلسله مراتبی از بالا به پایین را رد کرده و به جای آن برای تلاقی شبکه‌ای نظیر به نظیر، ارزش قائل می‌شود.
833,"
Ilyse Hogue, a progressive activist who was on the staff of MoveOn for many years, recently put it this way, in one of the first uses of the term ""leader-full"" that I have seen:",الیس هوگ، فعال پیشرو که سالها در ستاد مووآن بوده، اخیراً در یکی از اولین کاربردهای اصطلاح «پر از رهبر» که تاکنون دیده‌ام، می نویسد:
834,"

""We should all strive not for leaderless movements, but for leaderFULL movements.",«همگی نباید برای جنبشهای بدون رهبر تلاش کنیم، بلکه برای جنبشهایی تلاش کنیم که پر از رهبر هستند.»
835," The former trends towards autocratic loudest voices dominating. In their best manifestation, the latter creates equitable space to raise up all voices, create mechanisms for group decision making and accountability, and to catalyze self-responsibility and empowerment.""
",روندهای قبلی به سمتی گرایش داشتند که بلندترین صداهای استبدادی، حاکم بودند. اما این روند در بهترین نمود خود، فضایی متساوی برای برخاستن تمامی صداها ایجاد می‌کند و سازوکارهایی را برای تصمیم‌گیری و مسئولیت‌پذیری گروهی و کاتالیز کردن مسئولیت‌پذیری و اختیار شخصی ایجاد می‌کند.
836,"
Most of us come from a world and a generation that only knows one kind of leadership, the one whose organizational structure looks like a confusing government flowchart.",بیشتر ما از دنیا و نسلی هستیم که تنها یک نوع رهبری را می‌شناسیم، نوعی که ساختار سازمانی آن شبیه فلوچارت دولتی گیج کننده است.
837,"

Everything about our industrial age institutions, from schools and churches to corporations and government, trains us to think of leadership as top-down, command-and-control. 
",هر چیزی درباره نهادهای عصر صنعتی از مدارس و کلیساها گرفته تا سازمان‌ها و دولت، به ما اندیشه رهبری از بالا به پایین، دستور دادن و کنترل کردن را می آموزند.
838,"Give the right answer, get into the right school, get a good job, work your way up the chain of command, win the good life.",جواب درست را بده، به مدرسه درستی برو، شغل خوبی بگیر، کار خود را در زنجیره فرماندهی انجام بده و زندگی خوبی را برپا کن.
839," But today, more and more of us live in a sea of lateral social connections, enabled by personal technology that is allowing everyone to connect and share, in real-time, what matters most to them.",اما امروز، زندگی بیشتر ماها در دریایی از ارتباطات اجتماعی جانبی غوطه‌ور است که توسط فناوری شخصی پدیده می‌آید که به همگان اجازه می‌دهد تا آن‌چه که بیش از همه برای ‌آن‌ها مهم است را به هم مرتبط ساخته و به اشتراک بگذارند.
840,"
And at a moment when so many traditional political institutions appear bankrupt, incapable of reforming themselves and paralyzed in the face of huge challenges, the result is an explosion of outsider movements for social change whose structure looks more the masses of people that gathered in Egypt's Tahrir Square, the pro-union demonstrators in Wisconsin or the Occupy Wall Street protests around the country.
",و در زمانی که به نظر می‌رسد بسیاری از نهادهای سیاسی سنتی، ورشکسته شده‌اند، ناتوان از اصلاح خودشان مانده‌اند و در مواجهه با چالشهای بزرگ، فلج شده‌اند و نتیجه آن، انفجار جنبشهای بیرونی برای تغییر اجتماعی است که ساختار ‌آن‌ها بیشتر شبیه توده‌های مردمی است که در میدان التحریر قاهره جمع شده‌اند، تظاهرکنندگان طرفدار اتحادیه در ویسکانسین یا معترضین اشغال وال استریت در اطراف کشور.
841,"
Indeed, I think there's a reason we keep seeing this recurring image of a filled circle rather than a hierarchy in today's protest movements:
",در حقیقت، فکر می‌کنم که دلیلی وجود دارد که به جای دیدن سلسله مراتب در جنبشهای اعتراضی امروز، شاهد این تصویر مکرر از دایره‌ پر شده باشیم.
842, All the points on a circle are equidistant from the center.,تمامی نقاط دایره با فاصله یکسانی از مرکز قرار دارند.
843,"
Spots in the middle are hubs, but no one hub dominates.",نقاط میانه، مراکز هستند و هیچ مرکزی، تسلط ندارد.
844," Resilience is built through the multitude of lateral connections between all the points in the network, so if any hub fails, others can pick up the slack. ",مقاومت از طریق انبوهی از ارتباطات جانبی بین تمامی نقاط در شبکه صورت می‌گیرد که اگر هر مرکزی شکست بخورد، دیگران می‌توانند این گسیختگی را رفع کنند.
845,"

Going from a world of top-down leaders who use hierarchy, secrecy and spin to conduct their business to a leader-full world filled with self-starting network weavers who are transparent and accountable about their actions will take some getting used to.
",در حرکت از دنیای رهبران بالا به پایین که از سلسله مراتب، رازداری و  گردش برای انجام کارهای خود استفاده می‌کنند به جهانی پر از رهبر با تنیده هایی شبکه‌ای خود شروع کننده که درباره اقدامات خود، شفاف و پاسخگو هستند، لازم زمانی بگذرد تا عده‌ای به آن عادت کنند.
846,"And thus today's networked movements are not only highly participatory, with many leaders instead of just one, they are also much stronger than movements of the past that could be stopped or stalled by the discrediting, arrest or killing of their singular spokesmen.",و بنابر این جنبشهای شبکه‌ای امروز که به جای داشتن یک رهبر، رهبران  بسیاری دارند، نه تنها بسیار مشارکتی هستند بلکه بسیار قویتر از جنبشهای گذشته هستند که بی اعتبار کردن، دستگیری یا کشتن سخنگوی منفرد ‌آن‌ها، می‌توانست ‌آن‌ها را نابود یا متوقف کند.
847,"
But the Occupy Wall Street movement, like the Tea Party before it was captured and turned into a marketing vehicle for the Republican right, represents the flowering of something very deep about our networked age. ",اما جنبش اشغال وال استریت مانند تی‌پارتی که به ماشین بازاریابی برای راست جمهوریخواه تبدیل شد، شکوفا شدن چیزی را نشان می‌دهد که در بطن عصر شبکه‌‌سازی شده ما قرار دارد.
848,"It is personal democracy in action, where everyone plays a role in shaping the decisions that affect our lives. ",و آن دموکراسی شخصی در عمل است که در آن هر کس در شکل بخشیدن به تصمیماتی که بر زندگیمان تاثیر می‌گذارد، نقشی ایفا می‌کند.
849,"We may face huge challenges, but while some of our material resources are in scarce supply, we have an abundance of leaders coming.",ممکن است با چالشهای بزرگی روبرو شویم اما با آن‌که برخی از منابع مادی ما اندک است، اما رهبران زیادی داریم که وارد عرصه می‌شوند.

Such an attack would be significant because Syria's Air Force Intelligence is one of the most feared state agencies and has been involved in the suppression of protests against President Bashar al-Assad.
",چنین حمله‌ای اهمیت خواهد داشت زیرا اطلاعات نیروی هوایی سوریه یکی از مخوف‌ترین سازمانهای دولتی است که در سرکوبی اعتراضات علیه رئیس‌جمهور بشار الاسد دخالت داشته است.

911,"The divestiture is an attempt to address the concerns of the Justice Department, which sued to block the takeover on August 31 saying the deal would ""substantially lessen competition"" in the wireless market, Bloomberg said.",بلومبرگ می‌گوید که رهاسازی تلاشی است برای رسیدگی به نگرانی‌های وزارت دادگستری که در 31 آگوست اعلام کرد که این معامله، «به صورت اساسی، رقابت را در بازار بیسیم» کاهش می‌دهد و برای توقف این تصاحب، اقامه دعوی کرد.
912,"The proposed deal was dealt another blow on November 22, when the Federal Communications Commission's chairman sought to have it sent to an administrative law judge for review.",معامله پیشنهادی به ضربه دیگری در 22 نوامبر نیز پاسخ داده است که در آن هنگام، رئیس کمیسیون ارتباطات فدرال در صدد بود تا این تصاحب را برای بررسی به قاضی قانون اجرایی ارجاع دهد.
913,"The asset-sale proposal, which could come as early as the next Justice Department hearing on November 30, might be the only remaining option if the second-largest U.S. wireless operator wants to avoid a lengthy court battle in its bid to become the country's top mobile carrier, Bloomberg said.",پیشنهاد فروش دارایی که ممکن است در جلسه رسیدگی بعدی وزارت دارایی در 30 نوامبر مطرح شود، تنها گزینه باقیمانده‌ برای دومین اپراتور بزرگ بیسیم ایالات متحده است تا از نبرد دادگاهی دنباله‌دار بر سر درخواست آن برای تبدیل به حامل برتر موبایل کشور اجتناب کند.
914,"Philippine police and the FBI have arrested four people that Manila said were paid by a militant Saudi Arabian-based group to hack into U.S. telecom AT&T's system, but the company said it was neither targeted nor breached.",پلیس فیلیپین و FBI چهار نفر را در مانیل دستگیر کردند که می‌گفتند گروه شبه نظامی مستقر در عربستان به آن‌ها پول داده تا به سیستم مخابراتی AT&T ایالات متحده ضربه بزند اما این شرکت می‌گوید که نه هدف قرار گرفته و نه تجاوزی به آن صورت گرفته است.
915,The Philippines' Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) said those arrested in Wednesday's operation in Manila with the Federal Bureau of Investigation were paid by the same group the FBI said had funded the November 2008 attacks in Mumbai.,گروه تحقیق و آشکارسازی جنایی فیلیپین (CIDG) می‌گوید که ‌آن‌هایی که در عملیات روز چهارشنبه در مانیل دستگیر شده‌اند به گفته دفتر تحقیق فدرال، همان هایی هستند که حملات نوامبر 2008 در بمبئی را سرمایه‌گذاری کرده‌اند.
916,"""The hacking activity resulted in almost $2 million in losses incurred by the company,"" the CIDG said in a statement.",CIDG در بیانیه‌ای می‌گوید:«فعالیت ضربه منجر به وارد شدن خسارت 2 میلیون دلاری به این شرکت شده است.‌»
917,"It did not name the group who it said had funded the Mumbai attacks, but India has blamed the militant Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) for carrying out the attacks which killed 166 people.",آن از گروهی که حملات بمبئی را سرمایه‌گذاری کرد، نام نبرد اما هند گروه شبه‌نظامی لشگر طیبه (LeT) مستقر در پاکستان را بابت انجام حملاتی که 166 کشته بر جای گذاشت، مقصر می‌داند.
918,"AT&T, the No. 2 U.S. mobile provider, said it ""ended up writing off some fraudulent charges that appeared on customer bills"" but did not comment on the $2 million figure.",AT&T، تامین کننده شماره 2 موبایل ایالات متحده می‌گوید که «نوشتن برخی اتهامات متقلبانه که در صورتحسابهای مشتری ظاهر شده را به پایان برده است» اما نظری در مورد رقم دو میلیون دلار نداد.
919,"""AT&T and its network were neither targeted nor breached by the hackers,"" AT&T spokeswoman Jan Rasmussen said. ",ژان راسموسن سخنگوی AT&T می‌گوید:« AT&T‌و شبکه‌ آن مورد حمله و مورد تجاوز هکرها قرار نگرفته است.»
920,"""AT&T only assisted law enforcement in the investigation that led to the arrest of a group of hackers.""",« AT&T‌تنها به اجرای قانون در تحقیقی اصرار دارد که به دستگیری گروهی از هکرها منجر شده است.»
921,"Police said the suspects had hacked into the trunk-lines of different telecom companies, including AT&T, with revenues diverted to accounts of the unnamed Saudi-based group.",پلیس می‌گوید که مظنونان در خطوط شاه سیم شرکت‌های مخابراتی مختلف منجمله AT&T هک کرده بودند و درآمدها به حساب گروه ناشناخته مستقر در عربستان واریز می‌شد.
922,"Earlier this week, AT&T said it was investigating an attempt to access customer information, but did not believe any accounts had been breached.
",AT&T در ابتدای این هفته، اعلام کرد که در حال بررسی تلاشی برای دسترسی اطلاعات مشتری است اما باور ندارد که به هر گونه حسابی دسترسی نداشته باشد.
923,The CIDG said the FBI sought the help of its Anti-Transnational and Cyber Crime Division (ATCCD) in March after they found the Saudi group had targeted AT&T using the hackers.,CIDG می‌گوید که FBI در صدد کمک به بخش ضد جرایم سایبری و بین المللی (ATCCD) در ماه مارس بعد از آن‌ است که ‌آن‌ها دریافتند که این گروه سعودی AT&T را با استفاده از هکرها، هدف گرفته است.
924,"
Among the four arrested was 29-year-old Paul Michael Kwan, who ATCCD chief Police Senior Superintendent Gilbert Sosa said had been arrested in 2007 after the FBI launched an international crackdown on groups suspected of financing militant activities.
",در میان 4 نفری که دستگیر شدند، پائول مایکل کوان 29 ساله حضور دارد که گیلبرت سوسا، رئیس پلیس ATCCD می‌گوید که او در سال 2007 بعد از حمله بین المللی به گروههای مظنون در تامین مالی فعالیتهای شبه‌نظامی دستگیر شده است.
925,"Sosa said in the statement the Filipinos were being paid by a group originally run by Muhammad Zamir, a Pakistani arrested in Italy in 2007. ",سوسا در بیانیه‌ای می‌گوید که گروهی به فلیپینوس پول می‌داد که در ابتدا توسط محمد زامیر اهل پاکستان اداره می شده که در سال 2007 در ایتالیا دستگیر شده است.
926,"He said Zamir was a member of Jemaah Islamiah, a Southeast Asian militant network with links to al Qaeda.",او می‌گوید که زامیر عضو جماعت اسلامی است. این گروه شبکه شبه‌نظامی جنوب شرقی آسیاست که ارتباطاتی با القاعده دارد.
927,"""Zamir's group, later tagged by the FBI to be the financial source of the terrorist attack in Mumbai, India, on November 26, 2008, is also the same group that paid Kwan's group of hackers in Manila,"" Sosa said in the statement.",سوسا در این بیانیه می‌گوید:«گروه زامیر که بعداً توسط FBI به عنوان منبع مالی حمله تروریستی در بمبئی هند در 26 نوامبر 2008 نامیده شده است، همان گروهی است که به گروه هکرهای کوان در مانیلا، پول پرداخت کرده است.»
928,"Last month, Philippine police said weak laws against cyber crime and poor technical capabilities had made the country an attractive base for organized crime syndicates involved in cyber pornography, cyber sex dens, illegal gambling, credit card fraud and identity theft.",ماه گذشته، پلیس فیلیپین اعلام کرد که قوانین ضعیف علیه جرایم سایبری و توانمندیهای ضعیف فنی این کشور را به پایگاه جذابی برای گروههای تبهکار سازمان یافته دخیل در هرزه‌نگاری سایبری، لانه‌های سکس سایبری، قماربازی غیرقانونی، تقلب کارت اعتباری و سرقت هویت بدل کرده است.
929,Sprint Nextel may be forced to abandon the biggest advantage it has over its rivals - unlimited data services for a flat fee - because of heavy data users and a shortage of wireless airwaves.,اسپرینت نکستل ممکن است مجبور شود به خاطر کاربران زیاد داده‌ای و کمبود امواج هوایی بیسیم، بزرگترین مزیت خود بر رقیبانش-خدمات داده‌های نامحدود برای هزینه ثابت- را رها کند.
930,"Moreover, the increasing likelihood that AT&T's plan to buy T-Mobile USA, the nation's fourth-largest mobile operator, will fail may have the paradoxical result of making Sprint's position even more untenable, according to analysts who follow all three companies.",علاوه بر این، طبق نظر تحلیلگرانی که این سه شرکت را تعقیب می‌کنند، احتمال فزاینده مبنی بر این‌که طرح برای خرید تی-موبایل ایالات متحده، چهارمین اپراتور موبایل کشور، شکست بخورد ممکن است نتیجه متناقضی داشته و موقعیت اسپرینت را غیرقابل دفاع سازد.
931,"Sprint, the nation's third-largest mobile service provider, is planning to upgrade its network with the latest mobile standard, Long Term Evolution. But it is launching that service with only half the wireless airwaves bigger rivals Verizon Wireless and AT&T Inc have assigned, leading experts to suggest that the popularity of Sprint's unlimited data plan could put a strain on the network or slow down Web surfing speeds.",اسپرینت، سومین تامین کننده بزرگ سرویس موبایل کشور در نظر دارد شبکه خود را با آخرین استاندارد موبایل یعنی لانگ ترم اوولوشن، به‌روز رسانی‌ کند. ولی آن سرویس را تنها با نیمی از امواج هوایی بیسیم که رقیبان بزرگتر یعنی وریزون وایرلس و AT&T از آن برخوردارند، راه‌انداز ی می‌کند که این امر سبب شده تا متخصصان اظهار دارند که محبوبیت طرح داده‌های نامحدود اسپرینت ممکن است سبب ایجاد محدودیت بر شبکه یا کند شدن سرعت وبگردی شود.
932,"Sprint has assigned just 10 megahertz of spectrum for the launch compared with its rivals' 20 megahertz, analysts say.",تحلیلگران می‌گویند که اسپرینت در مقایسه با طیف 20 مگاهرتزی رقیبان خود، فقط 10 مگاهرتز طیف را برای راه‌اندازی اختصاص داده است.
933, It will have to reassign airwaves being used for other services in order to expand its capacity for LTE.,اسپرینت برای گسترش ظرفیت خود برای LTE، باید امواج هوایی مورد استفاده برای سایر سرویس‌ها را مجدداً اختصاص دهد.
934,"Unlike AT&T and Verizon, which cap data use to stem overcapacity issues brought on by heavy users, Sprint is the only big U.S. carrier still selling unlimited data for a flat fee to users of smartphones, including the Apple Inc iPhone, on its current network.",بر خلاف و وریزون که استفاده از داده‌ها را برای رفع مشکلات اضافه ظرفیت ناشی از کاربران پرمصرف، می‌پوشانند، اسپرینت تنها حامل بزرگ ایالات متحده است که همچنان در شبکه کنونی خود، داده‌های نامحدودی را با هزینه ثابت برای کاربران گوشی‌های هوشمند منجمله آیفون شرکت اپل می‌فروشد.
935,"""It's a very bare-bones implementation of LTE,"" said Tolaga Research analyst Phil Marshall.",فیل مارشال تحلیلگر تولاگا ریسرچز می‌گوید:«این اجرای بسیار لاغر LTE است.»
936," ""The risk is, if you don't have headroom as your LTE subscriber base grows, then the speeds will go down.""",«ریسک این است که اگر هنگام رشد مبنای مشترک LTE خود، سقف آزادی را نداشته باشید، سرعت کاهش خواهد یافت.» 
937,"In that situation, Marshall does not see Sprint being able to continue to offer unlimited services.
",در این موقعیت، مارشال نمی‌تواند متصور باشد که اسپرینت بتواند به ارائه خدمات ادامه دهد.
938,"""Unlimited is going to kill them,"" he said.",او می‌گوید:«خدمات نامحدود به معنای از بین بردن این خدمات است.»
939," ""I think they're going to have to back off from the all-you-can-eat plan.""",«فکر می‌کنم که ‌آن‌ها می‌خواهند از طرح هر چه می‌توانید بخورید، عقب‌نشینی کنند.
940,"Unlimited data is a strong selling point for Sprint, which has been struggling for years to retain customers.",داده‌های نامحدود، نقطه فروش قوی برای اسپرینت است که سالهاست برای نگهداشتن مشتریان تلاش می‌کند.
941," For Sprint to keep the marketing advantage it has over rivals, one option could be for it to institute usage caps that are considerably higher than those of its competitors.",یک گزینه برای اسپرینت جهت حفظ مزیت بازاریابی بر رقبای خود، برقرار کردن سرپوشهای کاربری است که به صورت قابل ملاحظه‌ای بالاتر از رقیبانش است.
942,"""That's a lever they can play if they run into being constrained,"" said an industry source who asked not to be named due to a lack of authorization to speak publicly.",یک منبع صنعتی که خواست به خاطر عدم اجازه در سخن گفتن علنی، نامش برده نشود، گفت:«این اهرمی است که اگر در وضعیت نامحدود اجرا کنند می‌توانند با آن بازی کنند.»
943," ""It's inevitable that they will eventually have to put caps (on their data use).""",«این که ‌آن‌ها در نهایت (بر کاربرد داده‌های خود) سرپوش بگذارند، امری اجتناب‌ناپذیر است.
944,"Sprint, which is spending $7 billion to upgrade its network to LTE by the end of 2013, says concerns about its capacity are overblown, arguing that advanced technology allows it to make the most of its spectrum resources. ",اسپرینت که برای به روزرسانی شبکه خود به در پایان سال 2013، 7 میلیارد دلار هزینه می‌کند می‌گوید که نگرانی‌ها درباره ظرفیت آن، اغراق شده است و عنوان می‌کند که فناوری پیشرفته به آن اجازه می‌دهد تا از بیشترین منابع طیفی خود استفاده کند.
945,"Bob Azzi, a Sprint executive in charge of the company's network, said the company's plans assume that it will keep its unlimited data service during the LTE rollout.",باب عزیزی، مدیر مسئول شبکه شرکت اسپرینت می‌گوید که در طرح شرکت فرض شده که این شرکت در گسترش LTE، خدمت داده‌های نامحدود خود را حفظ‌ خواهد کرد.
946,"Azzi added that the section of the 1,900 megahertz spectrum band Sprint has set aside for LTE is currently unused.",عزیزی افزود که بخش باند طیق 1900 مگاهرتزی که اسپرینت برای LTE کنار گذاشته است، اکنون بلااستفاده است.
947," He also plans to reallocate spectrum in its 800 megahertz band to use for the high-speed service by early 2014, provided it can secure regulatory approval to do so. ",همچنین او طرحهایی برای تخصیص مجدد در باند 800 مگاهرتزی خود برای استفاده در خدمت سرعت بالا در اوایل 2014 در دست دارد، مشروط بر آن‌که بتواند تایید قانونی را برای انجام آن تضمین کند.
948,That spectrum is currently being used by the aging iDen service Sprint hopes to shut down in mid-2013.,اکنون سرویس قدیمی iDen از این طیف استفاده می‌کند که اسپرینت امیدوار است آن را در میانه سال 2013 ببندد.
949,"Sprint is also in talks with Clearwire Corp, its majority-owned venture, about expanding their partnership to cover LTE. ",همچنین اسپرینت در حال گفتگو با کلیروایر کورپ، که عمدتاً مالک آن است، می‌باشد تا مشارکت ‌آن‌ها را در پوشش LTE افزایش دهد.
950,"Sprint currently depends on Clearwire's network for its fastest service based on WiMax technology, and the latest talks are aimed at allowing it to piggyback on Clearwire's LTE to help it boost capacity in the ""hottest of hotspots"" by 2014 when Azzi says Sprint will need more capacity.",اکنون اسپرینت برای سریعترین خدمات خود بر مبنای فناوری وایمکس به شبکه کلیروایر متکی است و هدف از گفتگوهای اخیر، اجازه دادن به آن برای سوار شدن بر LTE کلیر وایر برای کمک به ارتقای ظرفیت آن در «داغ‌ترین نقاط داغ» در سال 2014 و زمانی است که عزیزی می‌گوید، اسپرینت به ظرفیت بیشتری نیاز دارد.
951,But the future of Sprint's tempestuous relationship with Clearwire is murky since it is not yet certain if Clearwire will raise the roughly $1 billion in new funding it needs to upgrade its network to LTE.,اما آینده رابطه توفانی اسپرینت با کلیروایر، تیره است زیرا هنوز معلوم نیست که آیا کلیروایر، تقریباً یک میلیارد دلاری که در سرمایه‌گذاری جدید برای ارتقای شبکه آن به LTE نیاز دارد ، افزایش خواهد داد.
952,"
Clearwire lost one-third of its value after Sprint said onOctober 7 that a bankruptcy filing by the company could be ""constructive."" ",بعد از آن‌که اسپرینت در روز 7 اکتبر اعلام کرد اعلام ورشکستگی شرکت ممکن است «سازنده» باشد، کلیروایر، یک سوم ارزش خود را از دست داد.
953,"Clearwire shareholders again fled on November 18 after the company said it may skip a debt interest payment due December 1. Many analysts saw that pronouncement as a negotiating tactic to try to force Sprint's hand into an agreement with favorable terms for Clearwire.
",سهامداران کلیروایر مجدداً در 18 نوامبر گریختند و این زمانی بود که شرکت اعلام کرد که ممکن است در اول دسامبر از پرداخت بهره وام، صرفنظر کند. بسیاری از تحلیلگران این اعلامیه را تاکتیک مذاکراتی برای تلاش در وادار کردن اسپرنیت به توافق با شرایط مطلوب برای کلیر وایر می‌دانند.
954,"One investment manager described the Clearwire/Sprint relationship as a ""soap opera"" that will end with an agreement because they are both heavily dependent on each other.",یک مدیر سرمایه‌گذاری، رابطه کلیروایر/اسپرینت را به صورت «اپرای تلویزیونی» توصیف کرد که با توافق به پایان می‌رسد زیرا آن‌ها وابستگی زیادی با همدیگر دارند.
955,"
""In the short term Sprint doesn't need them beyond (WiMax) but they do need them later,"" said the manager, who asked not to be named.
",مدیر که خواست نامش برده نشود، گفت:«در کوتاه مدت، اسپرینت به فراتر از ‌آن‌ها (وایمکس) نیاز ندارد اما بعداً به ‌آن‌ها نیاز خواهد داشت.»
956,"Even if Sprint and Clearwire reach an agreement, however, Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett is skeptical about how much it would help because of the frequency Clearwire's spectrum is on, which he said causes signal problems within buildings.",البته کرایگ موفت، تحلیلگر برنستین حتی در صورت به توافق رسیدن اسپرینت و کلیروایر به علت فرکانس طیف کلیر وایر که سبب مشکلات سیگنال در ساختمانها می‌شود، در مورد موثر بودن این توافق کمک خواهد کرد، بدبین است.
957,"""Now that the person next to you at the conference table is surfing away on Verizon ... the shortcomings of Clearwire become painfully apparent,"" Moffett said.",موفت می‌گوید:«اکنون شخصی که در میز کنفرانس در کنار شماست، در حال وبگردی با وریزون است...و نقصهای کلیروایر به صورت دردناکی ظاهر می‌شود.»
958,"Moffett also noted that even if Clearwire upgrades its network, it will still have coverage for only about one-third of the U.S. population because it would need to raise a lot more funding than it is currently seeking to extend its network into new markets.",علاوه بر این موفت خاطرنشان کرد که اگر کلیروایر شبکه خود را ارتقا دهد، همچنان تنها حدود یک سوم جمعیت ایالات متحده را پوشش خواهد داد  زیرا لازم است بیش از آن‌چه که اکنون برای گسترش شبکه خود به بازارهای جدید تلاش می‌کند، سرمایه‌گذاری کند.
959,"Since Sprint has already had to tap capital markets for $4 billion in debt and needs up to $3 billion more in funding for its own network upgrade, analysts are skeptical it can come up with the money to help Clearwire expand further.",چون اسپرینت پیش از این می‌بایست 4 میلیارد دلار از بازارهای سرمایه وام بگیرد و به بیش از 3 میلیارد دلار  برای ارتقای شبکه خودش، سرمایه‌گذاری نیاز داشت، تحلیلگران در این مورد این شرکت بتواند پول لازم برای کمک به گسترش بیشتر کلیروایر را تامین کند، بدبین هستند.
960,"""What are you going to do with the (rest) of the United States? ",«شما برای بقیه ایالات متحده چه کار می‌کنید؟»
961,"You can't just limp around on one leg,"" said Moffett, who has a ""hold"" rating on Sprint due to the uncertainty around its strategy.",موفت که به‌علت تردید در مورد راهبرد اسپرینت، رتبه‌بندی «پایه» دارد می‌گوید:«نمی‌توانید با یک پا بلنگید.»
962,The uncertainty around AT&T's deal for T-Mobile USA is another big wrinkle in the Sprint story.,بلاتکلیفی در مورد توافق AT&T برای تی-موبایل ایالات متحده، بخش مهم دیگری از داستان اسپرینت است.
963," On Thursday, AT&T withdrew its application for deal approval with the Federal Communications Commission, saying that it would focus on its legal battle with the Department of Justice. ",در روز پنج‌شنبه، AT&T درخواست خود برای تایید توافق با کمیسیون ارتباطات فدرال را پس گرفت و گفت که بر نبرد حقوقی با وزارت دادگستری تمرکز خواهد کرد.
964,"If that deal is approved, it leaves Sprint as a distant No. 4. ",اگر این توافق تایید شود، اسپرینت را به عنوان دور شماره 4، برجای می‌گذارد.
965,"But if it is blocked, as many analysts now expect, T-Mobile USA may look for another partner, according to the investment manager.",اما به گفته مدیر سرمایه‌گذاری، اگر این توافق آن‌طور که بسیاری از تحلیلگران در حال حاضر انتظار دارند، مسدود شود، تی-موبایل ایالات متحده ممکن است به دنبال شریک دیگری بگردد.
966,"Instead of forging a deal with Clearwire or Sprint, Moffett suggested that T-Mobile USA would instead turn to U.S. cable operators such as Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable. ",موفت به جای بستن قرارداد با کلیروایر یا اسپرینت توصیه کرده است که تی-موبایل ایالات متحده در عوض به اپراتورهای کابلی ایالات متحده مانند کامکست کورپ و تایم وارنر کابل، توجه خواهد کرد.
967,Some investors had hoped these companies would come to Sprint's aid as they are part-owners in Clearwire. ,برخی از سرمایه‌گذاران امید داشتند که این شرکتها به عنوان بخش از مالکان در کلیروایر به کمک اسپرینت خواهند آمد.
968,"But since the cable operators have unused spectrum in the same band as T-Mobile USA, Moffett suggested that the cable providers would instead create a partnership with that company if it has to abandon the AT&T deal.",اما از آن‌جایی که اپراتورهای کابلی در همان باند تی-موبایل ایالات متحده، طیف استفاده نکرده‌ای دارند، موفت توصیه کرده که در صورت کنارگذاشتن توافق،  تامین‌کنندگان کابلی در عوض با آن شرکت رابطه‌ای را ایجاد خواهند کرد.
969,"Sprint has loudly opposed the AT&T/T-Mobile USA deal, a position that Moffett said was against its best interests.",اسپرینت علناً با توافق AT&T با تی-موبایل ایالات متحده مخالفت کرده است که به گفته موفت با بهترین منافعش، تضاد دارد.
970,"""Now Sprint loses its logical partners in the cable operators,"" said Moffett, who described a potential cable/T-Mobile deal as a ""match made in heaven.""",موفت که توافق بالقوه شرکت کابلی با تی-موبایل ایالات متحده را «ازدواج انجام شده در بهشت» توصیف می‌کند، می‌گوید:«اکنون اسپرینت، شرکای منطقی خود در اپراتورهای کابل را از دست داده است.»
971,"Moreover, some analysts said that the $6 billion breakup package AT&T will have to pay T-Mobile if the deal fails would make T-Mobile into a more formidable rival to Sprint in the market for cost-conscious mobile consumers.",علاوه بر این برخی تحلیلگران می‌گویند که در صورت شکست معامله‌ای که تی موبایل را به قدرتمندترین رقیب اسپرینت در بازار برای مشتریان حساس به هزینه موبایل تبدیل می‌کند، AT&T باید بسته رهایی 6 میلیارد دلاری را به تی موبایل پرداخت کند.
972,"The uncertainty means that Sprint does not ""know exactly how desperate they are at any given point in time,"" said the investment manager, noting that Sprint's $2.38 share price speaks volumes about investor confidence in the operator's strategy.",به گفته مدیر سرمایه‌گذاری، این عدم قطعیت به معنای آن است که اسپرینت «دقیقاً نمی‌داند که ‌آن‌ها در هر نقطه زمانی، چقدر ناامید هستند». او خاطرنشان می‌کند که بهای 38/2 دلاری سهم اسپرینت از حجم اطمینان سرمایه‌گذار به راهبرد بهره‌بردار حکایت می‌کند.

65," Results contrast with official poverty data, released in September, that put the number of poor Americans at 46.2 million.",
66,"The biggest rise occurred among people aged 65 and older who are being driven into poverty by out-of-pocket medical expenses, including premiums and co-pays from the federal government's Medicare program for the elderly.

It will now supplement official poverty estimates, which have been used to determine eligibility for programs that help the poor since the mid-1960s.

The broader formula generates an overall U.S. poverty rate of 16 percent, versus an official 15.1 percent, with an annual poverty income threshold of $24,343 for a family of four, compared with $22,113 under the official measure.

",
77," ""The programs we have right now are, if anything, inadequate.""",
78,"
The new formula also showed poverty rates increasing for whites, Asians and working-age adults but falling for blacks and children.
",
79,"
For the first time, the poverty rate for Hispanics eclipsed the rate among blacks, by 28.2 percent to 25.4 percent, partly as a result of less participation in social programs, like housing subsidies, among immigrant groups.
",
80,"
As an indication of the benefits of government assistance, Census officials said the poverty rate would have risen to 18 percent if not for earned income tax credit for people with low to moderate incomes.

The broader measure was developed in cooperation with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the National Academy of Sciences, Census officials said.

If he becomes prime minister, Monti could be expected to bring a distinctly different approach to governing than Italy has experienced over the past three years.

",
647,"
In the latter role, Monti gained prominence for his part in blocking a merger between U.S. firms Honeywell International and General Electric, thought to be a move that highlighted Europe's newfound regulatory clout.

By 4:30 a.m. Tuesday, the Lower Manhattan park was clear, with about 40 city crews in orange vests scraping up trash and pressure washing sidewalks.

The order -- which was later denied during Tuesday's hearing, had allowed protesters to bring back tents and other equipment.

817," I'd push hard to see if there are leaders and to profile them.""
",
818,"
Why this insistence on finding the supposed leaders of Occupy Wall Street? The reason goes beyond a desire to understand the movement's goals, I think, into something more existential that is rooted in a fundamental misunderstanding of how networking technology is changing politics.

For many traditional political observers such as Brisbane and his colleagues, the notion that a political movement might arise without charismatic leaders is inconceivable. ",
820,"Every previous movement, after all, has had its figureheads. ",

Most of us come from a world and a generation that only knows one kind of leadership, the one whose organizational structure looks like a confusing government flowchart.",

839," But today, more and more of us live in a sea of lateral social connections, enabled by personal technology that is allowing everyone to connect and share, in real-time, what matters most to them.",
840,"
And at a moment when so many traditional political institutions appear bankrupt, incapable of reforming themselves and paralyzed in the face of huge challenges, the result is an explosion of outsider movements for social change whose structure looks more the masses of people that gathered in Egypt's Tahrir Square, the pro-union demonstrators in Wisconsin or the Occupy Wall Street protests around the country.
",
841,"
Indeed, I think there's a reason we keep seeing this recurring image of a filled circle rather than a hierarchy in today's protest movements:
",
842, All the points on a circle are equidistant from the center.,

Spots in the middle are hubs, but no one hub dominates.",
844," Resilience is built through the multitude of lateral connections between all the points in the network, so if any hub fails, others can pick up the slack. ",
845,"

Going from a world of top-down leaders who use hierarchy, secrecy and spin to conduct their business to a leader-full world filled with self-starting network weavers who are transparent and accountable about their actions will take some getting used to.

846,"And thus today's networked movements are not only highly participatory, with many leaders instead of just one, they are also much stronger than movements of the past that could be stopped or stalled by the discrediting, arrest or killing of their singular spokesmen.",

965,"But if it is blocked, as many analysts now expect, T-Mobile USA may look for another partner, according to the investment manager.",
966,"Instead of forging a deal with Clearwire or Sprint, Moffett suggested that T-Mobile USA would instead turn to U.S. cable operators such as Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable. ",
967,Some investors had hoped these companies would come to Sprint's aid as they are part-owners in Clearwire. ,
968,"But since the cable operators have unused spectrum in the same band as T-Mobile USA, Moffett suggested that the cable providers would instead create a partnership with that company if it has to abandon the AT&T deal.",
969,"Sprint has loudly opposed the AT&T/T-Mobile USA deal, a position that Moffett said was against its best interests.",

971,"Moreover, some analysts said that the $6 billion breakup package AT&T will have to pay T-Mobile if the deal fails would make T-Mobile into a more formidable rival to Sprint in the market for cost-conscious mobile consumers.",
972,"The uncertainty means that Sprint does not ""know exactly how desperate they are at any given point in time,"" said the investment manager, noting that Sprint's $2.38 share price speaks volumes about investor confidence in the operator's strategy.",

26,"Monday came and went without any accord on who will lead a new national unity coalition, despite plenty of talk that a former vice president of the European Central Bank, Lucas Papademos, would get the job.

",
27,"But after an early burst of compromise as the EU turned the screws on both sides, the drive by the socialist and conservative parties to create a government which will rule only until February appeared to be losing momentum.



",
28,"Frustration was apparent in Brussels where officials said the new government had to show it was serious about implementing promises Athens has made to its EU and IMF lenders in return for the 130 billion-euro bailout.
",
29,"""It is essential that the entire political class is now restoring the confidence that had been lost in the Greek commitment to the EU/IMF program,"" said EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
",
30,"Prime Minister George Papandreou provoked chaos last week by calling a referendum on the bailout, a vote which would probably have rejected the package due to its demands for austerity. ",
31,"Papandreou backed down, but was forced into agreeing to make way for the unity coalition.",
32,"The stakes could not be higher. Greece faces bankruptcy in December when big debt repayments are due, unless it can get hold of more emergency funding soon.",
33," For the euro zone, it is a question of credibility with international financial markets.

For two years it has labored to solve the problems of Greece, a very small part of the bloc's economy, leading to doubts about how it would manage if the debt crisis engulfed the far bigger Italian or Spanish economies.

41,"Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi defied huge pressure to resign on Monday, desperately playing his last cards to save his crumbling government as fears over Italy's instability hit markets across Europe.

",
42,"Berlusconi denied reports by journalists close to him that he would resign within hours, immediately reversing a brief recovery in stock and government bond markets battered by political uncertainty in the euro zone's third economy.

",
43,"Yields on Italy's 10-year bonds hit 6.67 percent, their highest level since 1997, at one point on Monday, close to the 7 percent level seen as unsustainable for Italy's huge debt, one of the world's highest.
",
44," European stocks were also hit by the turmoil.
",
45,"The movements indicated how much markets saw Berlusconi's departure as the only way to reduce the pressure on Italian bonds which has fueled a revolt in his party, although there is deep uncertainty about what would follow if he stepped down.

",
46,"Government bond prices would recover and the yield spreads would narrow by a full percentage point if the government should fall, according to a Reuters survey of 10 fund managers last week.
",
47,"
Political sources said a late Sunday meeting of leaders of Berlusconi's PDL party had urged him to resign because of a major party revolt but he was still not convinced. ",
48,"However a confidence motion is likely this week in parliament.

",
49,"Government minister Gianfranco Rotondi said on Monday he was optimistic the parliamentary majority would hold. 

",
50,"Otherwise Italy would have to go to the polls, he said after meeting Berlusconi.
",
51,"The prospect of early elections, opposed by many PDL deputies including rebels, is one of the last cards left to Berlusconi. ",
52,"He said those who brought down the government at a time of national peril would be traitors who would make economic reforms more difficult.
",
53,"
The 75-year-old media magnate and his closest aides spent the weekend trying to win back the support of enough deputies to avoid humiliating defeat on Tuesday in a crunch vote to confirm a state financing bill which he has already lost once.
",
54,"
Chances of defeat in this vote seem to be receding although if he did lose it, Berlusconi could either resign immediately or be ordered by President Giorgio Napolitano to call a confidence vote.
",
55,"
The center-left opposition may abstain in the Tuesday vote to expose Berlusconi's lack of support without torpedoing an essential measure.",
56,"Despite Berlusconi's unflinching defiance, many of those around him believe his days are numbered and that he has no chance of implementing unpopular austerity measures with an extremely fragile majority.

",
57," La Stampa daily on Monday described the death throes of his government as a ""prolonged agony.""",
58,"However, even if he goes, the prospects for a way out of Italy's crisis remain obscure.",
59," Berlusconi and the Northern League insist the only alternative to him is an election early next year -- which would likely push back reforms even further.

",
60,"
The idea of a national unity or technocrat government, favored by markets, the opposition and probably the head of state, is opposed by Berlusconi and League leaders whose parliamentary support may well be necessary for it to function.
",
61,"Newspapers have estimated the number of potential party defectors at between 20 and 40, which would be more than enough to topple the government.",
62,"
Berlusconi has been meeting and telephoning rebels since he returned from a humiliating G20 summit in France on Friday in which he had to agree to IMF monitoring of Italy's progress in reforms he has long promised but so far not implemented.

63,"The number of poor Americans hit a record 49 million in 2010, or 16 percent, according to new data released on Monday that showed poverty rates for the elderly, Asians and Hispanics higher than previously known.

",
64,"The figures were calculated by the Census Bureau under a broad new measure intended to supplement the official standard with a fuller picture of poverty in the United States.
",
65," Results contrast with official poverty data, released in September, that put the number of poor Americans at 46.2 million.",
66,"The biggest rise occurred among people aged 65 and older who are being driven into poverty by out-of-pocket medical expenses, including premiums and co-pays from the federal government's Medicare program for the elderly.
",
67,"The poverty rate for the elderly jumped to 15.9 percent, or a roughly 1 in 6 senior citizens, versus 9 percent under the official count.
",
68,"
The findings highlight the challenges facing Republicans and Democrats on a special congressional ""super committee"" charged with cutting at least $1.2 trillion from the federal budget over the next 10 years.

",
69,"Both sides have proposed hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to Medicare, which threatens to explode the U.S. debt burden, despite intensive lobbying against reductions by groups that represents beneficiaries and healthcare providers.
",
70,"
""People will say this shows how crucial it is not to cut a penny out of Medicare spending. ",
71,"And that's unfortunate, because it's an argument against solving the deficit,"" said Ron Haskins of the Brookings Institution.

",
72,"
Like the government's Social Security pension system for the elderly, Medicare is also expected to be a hot-button issue in 2012 election politics for both parties as they vie for control of the White House and Congress.
",
73,"Unlike the Census Bureau's official poverty measure, which focuses on the food budgets and cash wages of the poor, the new calculation includes government benefits such as food stamps as well as household expenses like taxes, medical costs, housing and regional differences in the cost of living, the Census Bureau said in a report.
",
74,"
It will now supplement official poverty estimates, which have been used to determine eligibility for programs that help the poor since the mid-1960s.
",
75,"
The broader formula generates an overall U.S. poverty rate of 16 percent, versus an official 15.1 percent, with an annual poverty income threshold of $24,343 for a family of four, compared with $22,113 under the official measure.
",
76,"
""This shows that the social safety net is helping but not doing as much as we'd like to see,"" said Dave Cooper of the Economic Policy Institute.
",
77," ""The programs we have right now are, if anything, inadequate.""",
78,"
The new formula also showed poverty rates increasing for whites, Asians and working-age adults but falling for blacks and children.
",
79,"
For the first time, the poverty rate for Hispanics eclipsed the rate among blacks, by 28.2 percent to 25.4 percent, partly as a result of less participation in social programs, like housing subsidies, among immigrant groups.
",
80,"
As an indication of the benefits of government assistance, Census officials said the poverty rate would have risen to 18 percent if not for earned income tax credit for people with low to moderate incomes.

",
81,"
The broader measure was developed in cooperation with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the National Academy of Sciences, Census officials said.

Barnes & Noble did lower prices on some devices, a tacit recognition of the pressure Amazon put on it in September, when it slashed the price on its basic Kindle and introduced a screen touch reader that was cheaper than Barnes & Noble's.
",
99,"Barnes & Noble on Monday cut the price of the Nook Color to $199 from $249. But that raised the threat of Nook devices cannibalizing each other.
",
100,"
Barnes & Noble also cut the cost of its touchscreen Nook to $99, down from $139, matching the price of its Amazon counterpart.
",
101,"""They are (pricing) the Nook Color at $199, so for consumers looking at that price point, Nook Color may wind up being the stronger direct competition to the Kindle Fire,"" NPD's Rubin said, but noted that the Nook Color could end up eating into Nook Tablet sales.

An epic 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami March 11 wreaked havoc around Japan, killing more than 15,000 people.

If he becomes prime minister, Monti could be expected to bring a distinctly different approach to governing than Italy has experienced over the past three years.
",

While the hot-blooded Berlusconi was for many years a master of forming political alliances, Monti is known for his achievements as a ""Eurocrat,"" at the heart of Europe's institutions.

Mario Monti named Italian Prime Minister",

Dubbed Super Mario for his work in international finance, he served as a leading European Commission member for a decade -- including as commissioner for its financial services, market and taxation committee between 1995 and 1999 and as head of its competition committee from 1999 to 2004.
",
647,"
In the latter role, Monti gained prominence for his part in blocking a merger between U.S. firms Honeywell International and General Electric, thought to be a move that highlighted Europe's newfound regulatory clout.
",
648,"
He also tangled with U.S. computing giant Microsoft, ruling in 2004 that it had broken EU competition law by having ""abused its virtual monopoly power over the PC desktop in Europe.""
",

While such moves made headlines, Monti's interactions in business are still a stark contrast to that of Berlusconi.

Besides being active in politics, the outgoing prime minister is also a business personality as the owner of media and financial companies, as well as the legendary football club A.C. Milan.",

But beyond advisory roles with investment firm Goldman Sachs and Coca-Cola, Monti's resume suggests he's as much a creature of academics and policy-making as business.

Born in 1943 in the town of Varese in northern Italy's Lombardy region, Monti earned an economics and business degree from Milan's Bocconi University.",

The order -- which was later denied during Tuesday's hearing, had allowed protesters to bring back tents and other equipment.

949,"Sprint is also in talks with Clearwire Corp, its majority-owned venture, about expanding their partnership to cover LTE. ",
950,"Sprint currently depends on Clearwire's network for its fastest service based on WiMax technology, and the latest talks are aimed at allowing it to piggyback on Clearwire's LTE to help it boost capacity in the ""hottest of hotspots"" by 2014 when Azzi says Sprint will need more capacity.",
951,But the future of Sprint's tempestuous relationship with Clearwire is murky since it is not yet certain if Clearwire will raise the roughly $1 billion in new funding it needs to upgrade its network to LTE.,
952,"
Clearwire lost one-third of its value after Sprint said onOctober 7 that a bankruptcy filing by the company could be ""constructive."" ",
953,"Clearwire shareholders again fled on November 18 after the company said it may skip a debt interest payment due December 1. Many analysts saw that pronouncement as a negotiating tactic to try to force Sprint's hand into an agreement with favorable terms for Clearwire.
",
954,"One investment manager described the Clearwire/Sprint relationship as a ""soap opera"" that will end with an agreement because they are both heavily dependent on each other.",
955,"
""In the short term Sprint doesn't need them beyond (WiMax) but they do need them later,"" said the manager, who asked not to be named.
",
956,"Even if Sprint and Clearwire reach an agreement, however, Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett is skeptical about how much it would help because of the frequency Clearwire's spectrum is on, which he said causes signal problems within buildings.",
957,"""Now that the person next to you at the conference table is surfing away on Verizon ... the shortcomings of Clearwire become painfully apparent,"" Moffett said.",
958,"Moffett also noted that even if Clearwire upgrades its network, it will still have coverage for only about one-third of the U.S. population because it would need to raise a lot more funding than it is currently seeking to extend its network into new markets.",
959,"Since Sprint has already had to tap capital markets for $4 billion in debt and needs up to $3 billion more in funding for its own network upgrade, analysts are skeptical it can come up with the money to help Clearwire expand further.",
960,"""What are you going to do with the (rest) of the United States? ",
961,"You can't just limp around on one leg,"" said Moffett, who has a ""hold"" rating on Sprint due to the uncertainty around its strategy.",
962,The uncertainty around AT&T's deal for T-Mobile USA is another big wrinkle in the Sprint story.,
963," On Thursday, AT&T withdrew its application for deal approval with the Federal Communications Commission, saying that it would focus on its legal battle with the Department of Justice. ",
964,"If that deal is approved, it leaves Sprint as a distant No. 4. ",
965,"But if it is blocked, as many analysts now expect, T-Mobile USA may look for another partner, according to the investment manager.",
966,"Instead of forging a deal with Clearwire or Sprint, Moffett suggested that T-Mobile USA would instead turn to U.S. cable operators such as Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable. ",
967,Some investors had hoped these companies would come to Sprint's aid as they are part-owners in Clearwire. ,
968,"But since the cable operators have unused spectrum in the same band as T-Mobile USA, Moffett suggested that the cable providers would instead create a partnership with that company if it has to abandon the AT&T deal.",
969,"Sprint has loudly opposed the AT&T/T-Mobile USA deal, a position that Moffett said was against its best interests.",
970,"""Now Sprint loses its logical partners in the cable operators,"" said Moffett, who described a potential cable/T-Mobile deal as a ""match made in heaven.""",
971,"Moreover, some analysts said that the $6 billion breakup package AT&T will have to pay T-Mobile if the deal fails would make T-Mobile into a more formidable rival to Sprint in the market for cost-conscious mobile consumers.",
972,"The uncertainty means that Sprint does not ""know exactly how desperate they are at any given point in time,"" said the investment manager, noting that Sprint's $2.38 share price speaks volumes about investor confidence in the operator's strategy.",

44," European stocks were also hit by the turmoil.

",
46,"Government bond prices would recover and the yield spreads would narrow by a full percentage point if the government should fall, according to a Reuters survey of 10 fund managers last week.

47,"
Political sources said a late Sunday meeting of leaders of Berlusconi's PDL party had urged him to resign because of a major party revolt but he was still not convinced. ",

51,"The prospect of early elections, opposed by many PDL deputies including rebels, is one of the last cards left to Berlusconi. ",
52,"He said those who brought down the government at a time of national peril would be traitors who would make economic reforms more difficult.

The 75-year-old media magnate and his closest aides spent the weekend trying to win back the support of enough deputies to avoid humiliating defeat on Tuesday in a crunch vote to confirm a state financing bill which he has already lost once.
",
54,"
Chances of defeat in this vote seem to be receding although if he did lose it, Berlusconi could either resign immediately or be ordered by President Giorgio Napolitano to call a confidence vote.

56,"Despite Berlusconi's unflinching defiance, many of those around him believe his days are numbered and that he has no chance of implementing unpopular austerity measures with an extremely fragile majority.

58,"However, even if he goes, the prospects for a way out of Italy's crisis remain obscure.",
59," Berlusconi and the Northern League insist the only alternative to him is an election early next year -- which would likely push back reforms even further.

The idea of a national unity or technocrat government, favored by markets, the opposition and probably the head of state, is opposed by Berlusconi and League leaders whose parliamentary support may well be necessary for it to function.

61,"Newspapers have estimated the number of potential party defectors at between 20 and 40, which would be more than enough to topple the government.",

63,"The number of poor Americans hit a record 49 million in 2010, or 16 percent, according to new data released on Monday that showed poverty rates for the elderly, Asians and Hispanics higher than previously known.

",
64,"The figures were calculated by the Census Bureau under a broad new measure intended to supplement the official standard with a fuller picture of poverty in the United States.
",
65," Results contrast with official poverty data, released in September, that put the number of poor Americans at 46.2 million.",
66,"The biggest rise occurred among people aged 65 and older who are being driven into poverty by out-of-pocket medical expenses, including premiums and co-pays from the federal government's Medicare program for the elderly.
",
67,"The poverty rate for the elderly jumped to 15.9 percent, or a roughly 1 in 6 senior citizens, versus 9 percent under the official count.
",
68,"
The findings highlight the challenges facing Republicans and Democrats on a special congressional ""super committee"" charged with cutting at least $1.2 trillion from the federal budget over the next 10 years.

",
69,"Both sides have proposed hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to Medicare, which threatens to explode the U.S. debt burden, despite intensive lobbying against reductions by groups that represents beneficiaries and healthcare providers.
",
70,"
""People will say this shows how crucial it is not to cut a penny out of Medicare spending. ",
71,"And that's unfortunate, because it's an argument against solving the deficit,"" said Ron Haskins of the Brookings Institution.

",
72,"
Like the government's Social Security pension system for the elderly, Medicare is also expected to be a hot-button issue in 2012 election politics for both parties as they vie for control of the White House and Congress.
",
73,"Unlike the Census Bureau's official poverty measure, which focuses on the food budgets and cash wages of the poor, the new calculation includes government benefits such as food stamps as well as household expenses like taxes, medical costs, housing and regional differences in the cost of living, the Census Bureau said in a report.
",
74,"
It will now supplement official poverty estimates, which have been used to determine eligibility for programs that help the poor since the mid-1960s.
",
75,"
The broader formula generates an overall U.S. poverty rate of 16 percent, versus an official 15.1 percent, with an annual poverty income threshold of $24,343 for a family of four, compared with $22,113 under the official measure.
",
76,"
""This shows that the social safety net is helping but not doing as much as we'd like to see,"" said Dave Cooper of the Economic Policy Institute.
",
77," ""The programs we have right now are, if anything, inadequate.""",
78,"
The new formula also showed poverty rates increasing for whites, Asians and working-age adults but falling for blacks and children.
",
79,"
For the first time, the poverty rate for Hispanics eclipsed the rate among blacks, by 28.2 percent to 25.4 percent, partly as a result of less participation in social programs, like housing subsidies, among immigrant groups.
",
80,"
As an indication of the benefits of government assistance, Census officials said the poverty rate would have risen to 18 percent if not for earned income tax credit for people with low to moderate incomes.

",
81,"
The broader measure was developed in cooperation with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the National Academy of Sciences, Census officials said.

And at a moment when so many traditional political institutions appear bankrupt, incapable of reforming themselves and paralyzed in the face of huge challenges, the result is an explosion of outsider movements for social change whose structure looks more the masses of people that gathered in Egypt's Tahrir Square, the pro-union demonstrators in Wisconsin or the Occupy Wall Street protests around the country.

Indeed, I think there's a reason we keep seeing this recurring image of a filled circle rather than a hierarchy in today's protest movements:

Spots in the middle are hubs, but no one hub dominates.",
844," Resilience is built through the multitude of lateral connections between all the points in the network, so if any hub fails, others can pick up the slack. ",

Going from a world of top-down leaders who use hierarchy, secrecy and spin to conduct their business to a leader-full world filled with self-starting network weavers who are transparent and accountable about their actions will take some getting used to.

912,"The proposed deal was dealt another blow on November 22, when the Federal Communications Commission's chairman sought to have it sent to an administrative law judge for review.",
913,"The asset-sale proposal, which could come as early as the next Justice Department hearing on November 30, might be the only remaining option if the second-largest U.S. wireless operator wants to avoid a lengthy court battle in its bid to become the country's top mobile carrier, Bloomberg said.",
914,"Philippine police and the FBI have arrested four people that Manila said were paid by a militant Saudi Arabian-based group to hack into U.S. telecom AT&T's system, but the company said it was neither targeted nor breached.",
915,The Philippines' Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) said those arrested in Wednesday's operation in Manila with the Federal Bureau of Investigation were paid by the same group the FBI said had funded the November 2008 attacks in Mumbai.,
916,"""The hacking activity resulted in almost $2 million in losses incurred by the company,"" the CIDG said in a statement.",
917,"It did not name the group who it said had funded the Mumbai attacks, but India has blamed the militant Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) for carrying out the attacks which killed 166 people.",
918,"AT&T, the No. 2 U.S. mobile provider, said it ""ended up writing off some fraudulent charges that appeared on customer bills"" but did not comment on the $2 million figure.",
919,"""AT&T and its network were neither targeted nor breached by the hackers,"" AT&T spokeswoman Jan Rasmussen said. ",
920,"""AT&T only assisted law enforcement in the investigation that led to the arrest of a group of hackers.""",
921,"Police said the suspects had hacked into the trunk-lines of different telecom companies, including AT&T, with revenues diverted to accounts of the unnamed Saudi-based group.",
922,"Earlier this week, AT&T said it was investigating an attempt to access customer information, but did not believe any accounts had been breached.
",
923,The CIDG said the FBI sought the help of its Anti-Transnational and Cyber Crime Division (ATCCD) in March after they found the Saudi group had targeted AT&T using the hackers.,
924,"
Among the four arrested was 29-year-old Paul Michael Kwan, who ATCCD chief Police Senior Superintendent Gilbert Sosa said had been arrested in 2007 after the FBI launched an international crackdown on groups suspected of financing militant activities.
",
925,"Sosa said in the statement the Filipinos were being paid by a group originally run by Muhammad Zamir, a Pakistani arrested in Italy in 2007. ",
926,"He said Zamir was a member of Jemaah Islamiah, a Southeast Asian militant network with links to al Qaeda.",
927,"""Zamir's group, later tagged by the FBI to be the financial source of the terrorist attack in Mumbai, India, on November 26, 2008, is also the same group that paid Kwan's group of hackers in Manila,"" Sosa said in the statement.",
928,"Last month, Philippine police said weak laws against cyber crime and poor technical capabilities had made the country an attractive base for organized crime syndicates involved in cyber pornography, cyber sex dens, illegal gambling, credit card fraud and identity theft.",
929,Sprint Nextel may be forced to abandon the biggest advantage it has over its rivals - unlimited data services for a flat fee - because of heavy data users and a shortage of wireless airwaves.,
930,"Moreover, the increasing likelihood that AT&T's plan to buy T-Mobile USA, the nation's fourth-largest mobile operator, will fail may have the paradoxical result of making Sprint's position even more untenable, according to analysts who follow all three companies.",
931,"Sprint, the nation's third-largest mobile service provider, is planning to upgrade its network with the latest mobile standard, Long Term Evolution. But it is launching that service with only half the wireless airwaves bigger rivals Verizon Wireless and AT&T Inc have assigned, leading experts to suggest that the popularity of Sprint's unlimited data plan could put a strain on the network or slow down Web surfing speeds.",
932,"Sprint has assigned just 10 megahertz of spectrum for the launch compared with its rivals' 20 megahertz, analysts say.",
933, It will have to reassign airwaves being used for other services in order to expand its capacity for LTE.,
934,"Unlike AT&T and Verizon, which cap data use to stem overcapacity issues brought on by heavy users, Sprint is the only big U.S. carrier still selling unlimited data for a flat fee to users of smartphones, including the Apple Inc iPhone, on its current network.",
935,"""It's a very bare-bones implementation of LTE,"" said Tolaga Research analyst Phil Marshall.",
936," ""The risk is, if you don't have headroom as your LTE subscriber base grows, then the speeds will go down.""",
937,"In that situation, Marshall does not see Sprint being able to continue to offer unlimited services.
",
938,"""Unlimited is going to kill them,"" he said.",
939," ""I think they're going to have to back off from the all-you-can-eat plan.""",
940,"Unlimited data is a strong selling point for Sprint, which has been struggling for years to retain customers.",
941," For Sprint to keep the marketing advantage it has over rivals, one option could be for it to institute usage caps that are considerably higher than those of its competitors.",
942,"""That's a lever they can play if they run into being constrained,"" said an industry source who asked not to be named due to a lack of authorization to speak publicly.",
943," ""It's inevitable that they will eventually have to put caps (on their data use).""",
944,"Sprint, which is spending $7 billion to upgrade its network to LTE by the end of 2013, says concerns about its capacity are overblown, arguing that advanced technology allows it to make the most of its spectrum resources. ",
945,"Bob Azzi, a Sprint executive in charge of the company's network, said the company's plans assume that it will keep its unlimited data service during the LTE rollout.",
946,"Azzi added that the section of the 1,900 megahertz spectrum band Sprint has set aside for LTE is currently unused.",
947," He also plans to reallocate spectrum in its 800 megahertz band to use for the high-speed service by early 2014, provided it can secure regulatory approval to do so. ",
948,That spectrum is currently being used by the aging iDen service Sprint hopes to shut down in mid-2013.,
949,"Sprint is also in talks with Clearwire Corp, its majority-owned venture, about expanding their partnership to cover LTE. ",
950,"Sprint currently depends on Clearwire's network for its fastest service based on WiMax technology, and the latest talks are aimed at allowing it to piggyback on Clearwire's LTE to help it boost capacity in the ""hottest of hotspots"" by 2014 when Azzi says Sprint will need more capacity.",
951,But the future of Sprint's tempestuous relationship with Clearwire is murky since it is not yet certain if Clearwire will raise the roughly $1 billion in new funding it needs to upgrade its network to LTE.,
952,"
Clearwire lost one-third of its value after Sprint said onOctober 7 that a bankruptcy filing by the company could be ""constructive."" ",
953,"Clearwire shareholders again fled on November 18 after the company said it may skip a debt interest payment due December 1. Many analysts saw that pronouncement as a negotiating tactic to try to force Sprint's hand into an agreement with favorable terms for Clearwire.
",
954,"One investment manager described the Clearwire/Sprint relationship as a ""soap opera"" that will end with an agreement because they are both heavily dependent on each other.",
955,"
""In the short term Sprint doesn't need them beyond (WiMax) but they do need them later,"" said the manager, who asked not to be named.
",
956,"Even if Sprint and Clearwire reach an agreement, however, Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett is skeptical about how much it would help because of the frequency Clearwire's spectrum is on, which he said causes signal problems within buildings.",
957,"""Now that the person next to you at the conference table is surfing away on Verizon ... the shortcomings of Clearwire become painfully apparent,"" Moffett said.",
958,"Moffett also noted that even if Clearwire upgrades its network, it will still have coverage for only about one-third of the U.S. population because it would need to raise a lot more funding than it is currently seeking to extend its network into new markets.",
959,"Since Sprint has already had to tap capital markets for $4 billion in debt and needs up to $3 billion more in funding for its own network upgrade, analysts are skeptical it can come up with the money to help Clearwire expand further.",
960,"""What are you going to do with the (rest) of the United States? ",
961,"You can't just limp around on one leg,"" said Moffett, who has a ""hold"" rating on Sprint due to the uncertainty around its strategy.",
962,The uncertainty around AT&T's deal for T-Mobile USA is another big wrinkle in the Sprint story.,
963," On Thursday, AT&T withdrew its application for deal approval with the Federal Communications Commission, saying that it would focus on its legal battle with the Department of Justice. ",
964,"If that deal is approved, it leaves Sprint as a distant No. 4. ",
965,"But if it is blocked, as many analysts now expect, T-Mobile USA may look for another partner, according to the investment manager.",
966,"Instead of forging a deal with Clearwire or Sprint, Moffett suggested that T-Mobile USA would instead turn to U.S. cable operators such as Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable. ",
967,Some investors had hoped these companies would come to Sprint's aid as they are part-owners in Clearwire. ,
968,"But since the cable operators have unused spectrum in the same band as T-Mobile USA, Moffett suggested that the cable providers would instead create a partnership with that company if it has to abandon the AT&T deal.",
969,"Sprint has loudly opposed the AT&T/T-Mobile USA deal, a position that Moffett said was against its best interests.",
970,"""Now Sprint loses its logical partners in the cable operators,"" said Moffett, who described a potential cable/T-Mobile deal as a ""match made in heaven.""",
971,"Moreover, some analysts said that the $6 billion breakup package AT&T will have to pay T-Mobile if the deal fails would make T-Mobile into a more formidable rival to Sprint in the market for cost-conscious mobile consumers.",
972,"The uncertainty means that Sprint does not ""know exactly how desperate they are at any given point in time,"" said the investment manager, noting that Sprint's $2.38 share price speaks volumes about investor confidence in the operator's strategy.",
